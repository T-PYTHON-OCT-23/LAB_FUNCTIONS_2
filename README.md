# LAB_FUNCTIONS_2


## Create a function : find_primes that takes in 2 parameters of type int , and   . 

### hint
a prime number i a number that is divisible only by itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)    
Also , you can think of it as A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers


#### for example, primes between `25` and `50` are:
```
29   
31   
37   
41   
43   
47   
```

# Bonus
## write a function that takes a string as a parameter
- first check that the type of the parameter is of type str
- then, it should separates the word at any capital letter and replace it with a small letter 
- and  should return the new modified string !

Example: `helloWorldThere` should return :
```hello world there```
